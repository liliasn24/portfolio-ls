Answer this question in a README File attached to your portfolio, this should be submitted through the hw form as usual and also directly DM'd to Arthur.

## What challenges you experienced in your Unit-3 project?

 - APIs and how to manipulate the data in different components. 

## What questions do you have about the MERN Stack?

  - More than questions, I just need a better grasp of the State concept, I know what it does, but I'm not sure I can implement it from scratch. 

## Improvements to Unit 3 project:

  - Add compund interest formula to the project
  - Organize the files in the pages folder and on the components folder
  - Organize better the CSS code


## Improvements to Unit 1 project:

 - So many, but to start, re doing the CSS
 - Clean the code to have a better organization
